# Usage
from ANTLR dir, run in a cmd: `python main.py ../input_stream/<input_file>`

`input_file` can for example be `noerror.txt`.

This commands prints the parse tree generated by the input stream and also saves the tree to `output.txt`. It also creates `output.dot`. Copy and paste its content to `https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/` to get the parse tree visualized.

## Turn parse tree to .png in CLI
Command: `dot -Tpng output.dot -o output.png`

requirement: install graphviz from `https://graphviz.org/download/`. It is a safe app, even though Windows might not know it.

### Command sequence to create parse tree, save it as png, and open it
``` 
python main.py ../input_stream/noerror.txt
dot -Tpng output.dot -o output.png
output.png
```
