# Usage
from ANTLR dir, run in a cmd: `python main.py ../input_stream/<input_file>`

`input_file` can for example be `noerror.txt`.

This commands prints the parse tree generated by the input stream and also saves the tree to `output.txt`. It also creates `output.dot`. Copy and paste its content to `https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/` to get the parse tree visualized.
