# Usage
Before any other steps, make sure you have a recent python version and all requirements from `requirements.txt` installed.

## Create parser from grammar file

Usually, this already exists. Use the command if you made changes to the grammar.

Command: 
```
cd src
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 AlgoPractise.g4 -visitor -no-listener
```

move AlgoParser.py to _parser directory manually!
also Lexer to _lexer!


## Parse source code using generated parser
from root, run in a cmd: `python main.py input_stream/<input_file>`

`input_file` can for example be `noerror.txt`.

This commands prints the parse tree generated by the input stream and also saves the tree to `output.txt`. It also creates `output.dot`, which is a graphical representation of the parse tree for the source code. Copy and paste its content to `https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/` to get the parse tree visualized. Alternatively, turn the parse tree to .png in CLI using `dot -Tpng output.dot -o output.png`. Works only if graphviz is installed from `https://graphviz.org/download/`. It is a safe app, even though Windows might not know it.

### Command sequence to create parse tree, save it as png, and open it from root
``` 
python main.py input_stream/noerror.txt
dot -Tpng output.dot -o output.png
output.png
```
